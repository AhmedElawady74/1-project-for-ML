# first-project-for-ML
This project aims to analyze car data in Moldova using Python libraries specialized in data analysis and visualization. The data imported from a CSV file is utilized to analyze and visualize various aspects of the car market, such as price distribution, the relationship between price and year, and the distribution of cars by manufacturing year and fuel type.

The project involves the use of libraries such as pandas and numpy for efficient data handling, and matplotlib, seaborn, and plotly for creating interactive and visual plots. The data is represented through bar charts, scatter plots, and distribution plots to better understand and visualize the information.

Finally, basic statistics about the available numerical data in the dataset are displayed, aiding in a deeper understanding of the available information.
